This is my solution to the [day 59](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/swiftdata-wrap-up) challenge

It upgrades the [IExpense](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/SwiftUI/project7/iExpense) app:

1. Upgrade everything to use SwiftData.
2. Add a customizable sort order option: by name or by amount.
3. Add a filter option to show all expenses, just personal expenses, or just business expenses.
